\chapter{Applications}

A \jaxrs\ application consists of one or more resources (see chapter \ref{resources}) and zero or more providers (see chapter \ref{providers}). This chapter describes aspects of \jaxrs\ that apply to an application as a whole, subsequent chapters describe particular aspects of a \jaxrs\ application and requirements on \jaxrs\ implementations.

\section{Configuration}

The resources and providers that make up a \jaxrs\ application are configured via an application-supplied subclass of \code{Application\-Config}. An implementation MAY provide alternate mechanisms for locating resource classes and providers (e.g. runtime class scanning) but use of \code{Application\-Config} is the only portable means of configuration.

\section{Publication}

Applications are published in different ways depending on whether the application is run in a Java SE environment or within a container. This section describes the alternate means of publication.

\subsection{Java SE}

In a Java SE environment a configured instance of an endpoint class can be obtained using the \code{create\-Endpoint} method of \rd. The application supplies an instance of \code{Application\-Config} and the type of endpoint required. Implementations MUST support \code{javax\-.xml\-.ws\-.Provider} and MAY support other types.

How the resulting endpoint class instance is used to publish the application is outside the scope of this specification. JAX-WS describes how a \code{Provider} based endpoint can be published in an SE environment.

\subsection{Servlet}

When using a \jaxrs\ aware servlet container, the \code{servlet-class} element of the \code{web.xml} descriptor SHOULD name the application-supplied subclass of \code{Application\-Config}.

When using a non-\jaxrs\ aware servlet container, the \code{servlet-class} element of the \code{web.xml} descriptor SHOULD name the \jaxrs\ implementation-supplied Servlet class. The application-supplied subclass of \code{Application\-Config} is identified using an \code{init-param} with a \code{param-name} of \code{javax\-.ws\-.rs\-.Application\-Config}.
