\chapter{Contracts and Providers}

The \jaxrs\ runtime is extended using application-supplied provider classes. A provider is annotated with \Provider\ and implements a contract defined by an interface annotated with \Contract. \jaxrs defines two contracts: \EntityProvider\ and \HeaderProvider\, these are described below.

\section{Entity Providers}
\label{entity_providers}

The \EntityProvider\ interface defines the contract between the \jaxrs\ runtime and components that provide mapping services between Java types and their associated representations. A class wishing to provide such a service implements the \EntityProvider\ interface and is annotated with \Provider.

\subsection{Declaring Media Type Capabilities}
\label{declaring_provider_capabilities}

An \EntityProvider\ MAY restrict the media types it supports using the \ProduceMime\ and \ConsumeMime\ annotations. In the absence of either of these annotations, support for any media type (\lq\lq*/*\rq\rq) is assumed. An implementation MUST NOT use an \EntityProvider\ to map from a representation whose media type is not declared in a \ConsumeMime\ annotation nor to a representation whose media type is not declared in a \ProduceMime\ annotation.

When choosing an \EntityProvider\ an implementation sorts the available providers according to the media types they declare support for. Sorting of media types follows the general rule: x/y $<$ x/* $<$ */*, i.e. a provider that explicitly lists a media types is sorted before a provider that lists */*. Quality parameter values are also used such that x/y;q=1.0 $<$ x/y;q=0.7.

\subsection{Standard Entity Providers}
\label{standard_entity_providers}

An implementation MUST include pre-packaged \EntityProvider\ implementations for the following Java and media type combinations:

\begin{description}
\item[\code{byte[]}] All media types (\code{*/*}).
\item[\code{java.lang.String}] All text media types (\code{text/*}).
\item[\code{java.io.InputStream}] All media types (\code{*/*}).
\item[\code{java.io.File}] All media types (\code{*/*}).
\item[\code{javax.activation.DataSource}] All media types (\code{*/*}).
\item[\code{javax.transform.Source}] XML types (\code{text/xml}, \code{application\-/\-xml} and \code{application\-/\-*+xml}).
\item[\code{javax.xml.bind.JAXBElement} and application-supplied JAXB classes] XML media types (\code{text\-/\-xml}, \code{application/xml} and \code{application/*+xml}).
\item[\code{MultivaluedMap<String,String>}] Form content (\code{application/x-www-form-urlencoded}).
\end{description}

An implementation MUST support application-provided \EntityProvider\ implementations and MUST use those in preference to its own pre-packaged \EntityProvider\ implementations when either could handle the same request.

\subsection{Consuming a Request Entity Body}

The following describes the logical\footnote{Implementations are free to optimize their processing provided the results are equivalent to those that would be obtained if these steps are followed.} steps taken by a \jaxrs\ implementation when mapping a request entity body to a Java method parameter:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Identify the Java type of the parameter whose value will be mapped from the entity body. Section \ref{mapping_requests_to_java_methods} describes how the Java method is chosen.
\item Select the set of \EntityProvider\ classes that support the media type of the request, see section \ref{declaring_provider_capabilities}.
\item Iterate through the selected \EntityProvider\ classes and, utilizing the \code{supports} method of each, choose an \EntityProvider\ that supports the desired Java type.
\item Use the \code{readFrom} method of the chosen \EntityProvider\ to map the entity body to the desired Java type.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Producing a Response Entity Body}

The following describes the logical steps taken by a \jaxrs\ implementation when mapping a return value to a response entity body:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Obtain the object that will be mapped to the response entity body. For a return type of \Response\ or subclasses the object is the value of the \code{Entity} property, for other return types it is the returned object.
\item Obtain the effective value of \ProduceMime\ (see section \ref{declaring_method_capabilities}) and intersect that with the requested response formats to obtain set of permissible media types for the response entity body. Note that section \ref{mapping_requests_to_java_methods} ensures that this set will not be empty.
\item Select the set of \EntityProvider\ classes that support (see section \ref{declaring_provider_capabilities}) one or more of the permissible media types for the response entity body.
\item Sort the selected \EntityProvider\ classes as described in section \ref{declaring_provider_capabilities}.
\item Iterate through the sorted \EntityProvider\ classes and, utilizing the \code{supports} method of each, choose an \EntityProvider\ that supports the object that will be mapped to the entity body.
\item Use the \code{writeTo} method of the chosen \EntityProvider\ to map the object to the entity body.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Transfer Encoding}

Transfer encodings are handled by a component of the container or the \jaxrs\ runtime. Entity providers and application methods always operate on the HTTP entity body rather than directly on the HTTP message body.

\section{Header Providers}
\label{header_providers}

The \HeaderProvider\ interface defines the contract between the \jaxrs\ runtime and components that provide mapping services between Java types and their associated headers. A class wishing to provide such a service implements the \HeaderProvider\ interface and is annotated with \Provider.

Both \code{Response.Builder} and \EntityProvider\ allow arbitrary objects to be set as the value of headers, an implementation MUST first try to use a \HeaderProvider\ for the class of the value object and then, if none exists, use the object's \code{toString} method to serialize the value instead.

\subsection{Standard Header Providers}
\label{standard_header_providers}

An implementation MUST include pre-packaged \HeaderProvider\ implementations for the following \jaxrs\ types: \code{MediaType}, \code{EntityTag} and \code{NewCookie}.
